# CSMA-CD
Java implementation of CSMA/CD protocol using I-Persistent sensing.
In the intial implementation, 4 stations have been taken into consideration, each 50000km apart.
Maximum number of attempts per frame, is taken as 15.
Random number R = 0 to 2^k-1.
Backoff time has been calculated as RxTransmission time.
Number of frames to be sent per station is taken as an input.
